            <p>Cybersecurity, also known as computer security, refers to the protection of information and, in particular, the processing of it, with the goal of preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of data and processes. Its primary purpose is to ensure that both individuals and technological systems and data are safeguarded against damage and threats posed by third parties.<p>
            <p>Cyberattacks have increased by around 30%, which puts company information and data, which are the most important assets, at greater risk. That is why it is vital that, regardless of the size of a company, it protects itself and seeks to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.<p>

            <p>Not only threats arising from the programming and operation of a storage, transmission or processing device must be considered, there are also other non-computer circumstances that must be taken into account.<p>
            <p>Threats can be caused by:<p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users</li>
                <li>Malicious programs</li>
                <li>Programming errors</li>
                <li>An accident (theft, fire, flood)</li>
                <li>Internal technical staff</li>
                <li>Electronic or logical failures of computer systems in general</li>

                <p>Confidentiality of Information Also known as privacy, it refers to the idea that information should only be known to individuals who need to know it and have been authorized to do so. This principle ensures that information will not be disclosed accidentally or intentionally.<p>
                <p>Integrity of Information: Refers to the idea that information stored on devices or transmitted through any communication channel has not been maliciously manipulated by third parties. This ensures that information will not be altered by unauthorized individuals.<p>
                <p>Availability of Information: It pertains to the notion that information must always be available to authorized individuals for access and processing, and it can also be recovered in the event of a security incident that results in its loss or corruption. In other words, it ensures that information is available when needed.<p>

            <p>These are just some of the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity, but they are essential to help you protect your personal information and digital assets. Cybersecurity involves continuous learning and adapting to new threats, so it's important to stay informed and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in security.<p>
            <p>Here are a series of steps to take into account<p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure Password Management: Using strong and unique passwords is essential for protecting your online accounts and devices. Learn how to create strong passwords, use a password manager to manage them, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.</li>
                <li>Phishing Awareness: Phishing is a common technique that cybercriminals use to deceive individuals and steal personal information. You should learn to identify fraudulent emails and websites and never share sensitive information through suspicious links or messages.</li>
                <li>Secure Network Usage: Avoid connecting to unsecured or unknown public Wi-Fi networks. Whenever possible, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to encrypt your communications and protect your data when on a public network.</li>
                <li>Software Updates and Patches: Keeping your software and operating systems up to date is crucial. Updates often fix security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Enable automatic updates whenever possible.</li>

            If you are studying information security and want to understand more about the codes, here are some examples:
            <p>
                Use the code element to highlight code snippets related to your company's security policies. For example, you can display code snippets that describe secure password policies or access policies for critical systems.
                <code>
                    # Secure password policy
                    minimum_password_length = 12
                    require_special_characters = true
                </code>                
            </p>
            <p>
                Provide code examples in "code" elements as part of your cybersecurity training materials for employees. These examples can demonstrate how to identify phishing emails or how to set up a secure VPN connection.
                <code>
                        # Example of a phishing email
                        if sender_email.contains("paypal.com") and !sender_verified {
                        report_as_phishing()
                        }
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                Highlight code snippets that describe secure configurations in your security guides. This may include firewall configurations, authentication settings, and logging policies.
                <code>
                    # Firewall configuration
                    allow_traffic_from("Authorized_IP")
                    deny_all_traffic()
                    </code>                
            </p>

            <p>
                Display examples of secure code in your development resources so that developers can learn and apply secure programming practices. This may include examples of user input sanitization or encryption implementation.
                <code>
                    // User input sanitization
                    user_input = sanitize(user_input)
                </code>      
            </p>

            <p>
                Use "code" to show code snippets related to security incident response, such as data recovery scripts or forensic analysis.
                <code>
                    # Data recovery script
                    restore_data_from_backup()
                </code>           
                </p>
